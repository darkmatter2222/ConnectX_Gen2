## Tool Availability

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| WebSearch | ❌ Broken | API error 400 since iteration 5 |
| WebFetch | ✅ Working | Single-page lookups only |
| Bash/Glob/Read/Edit | ✅ Working | Repository inspection |
| Agent sub-agents | ✅ Working | Cannot use WebSearch (same API error) |

---

## Leading Architecture

**Hybrid Neural + Classical Search** (confidence: HIGH)

Combined with game-phase strategy:
- Opening (0-12 pieces): Tablebook / NN policy
- Midgame (12-34 pieces): Alpha-beta / PVS search
- Endgame (>34 pieces): Solved database lookup

## Priority Gaps

| ID | Category | Priority | Status |
|----|----------|----------|--------|
| CG-001 | Kaggle leaderboard | CRITICAL | ❌ BLOCKED (no web search; Kaggle pages require JS) |
| CG-002 | Top bot strategies | CRITICAL | ✅ RESOLVED (Round 6-7: 5 ConnectX repos + 10 Connect 4 repos via GitHub topics; GoodCoder666/katac4 analyzed) |
| CG-003 | RTX 5090 benchmarks | CRITICAL | ⏳ PENDING |
| CG-004 | 15x13 first-player advantage | CRITICAL | 🔍 PARTIAL — Wikipedia confirms 7x6, not 15x13 |
| GH-001 | MCTS variants | HIGH | ✅ RESOLVED (Round 7: 3 MCTS implementations analyzed, including katac4 with FPU/adaptive CPUCT) |
| GH-002 | TensorRT benchmarks | HIGH | ⏳ PENDING |
| GH-003 | CUDA search | HIGH | ⏳ PENDING |
| GH-004 | MTD(f) Python benchmark | HIGH | ✅ RESOLVED (Round 5) |
| GH-005 | Optimal CNN architecture | HIGH | 🔄 PARTIAL (katac4 ResNet with gated pooling now known) |
| GH-006 | Transfer learning effectiveness | HIGH | ✅ RESOLVED (Round 3) |

## Research Corpus

- **Legacy documents**: ~30 research files in `research/` (preserved, indexed in README)
- **Canonical files**: research-state.md (this file), research-trajectory.md, final-conclusion.md, research-gaps.md
- **Iteration reports**: iterations/round-NNN.md (starting with round 6)

## Next Round Focus Areas

1. Find the Böck database paper (ICAPS, JOCIG, Google Scholar via WebFetch — arXiv yields zero)
2. Research KataGo upstream engine — what techniques does katac4 port from the original?
3. rowspire neural network training methodology — how were weights trained? (currently random)
4. PUCT c_puct sensitivity analysis — 1.0 vs 1.4 vs 1.41 across different board sizes
5. Research Connect 4 opening theory — what are the strongest openings beyond center-column?
6. Find Kaggle ConnectX notebooks via direct URL patterns (page is 404)
